# student-depression-analysis-project-
🧠 Student Depression Analysis – Machine Learning Project

This project predicts depression levels among students using machine learning techniques. It analyzes factors such as academic pressure, sleep patterns, lifestyle habits, and stress indicators to classify the likelihood of depression and understand key contributing features.

📌 Project Objective

Build an ML model to classify depression levels (Low / Medium / High)

Identify major factors affecting student mental health

Clean, preprocess, and visualize the dataset

Evaluate multiple ML models to choose the best-performing one
